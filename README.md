# mta_lua_3d_math
Lua implementation of 3D frustum-plane intersection written for Multi Theft Auto San Andreas.

Uses Linear Algebra for software rendering 3D polygons. Comes with a RenderWare DFF parser so you can draw models from GTA:SA.

Uses some code from other sources. Credit is given where it is due (i.e. StackOverflow).
